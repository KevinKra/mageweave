							Created in the mid 1990's, Ruby was developed by a
							Japanese engineer named Yukihiro Matsumoto. "Matz",
							as he is more commonly known, aimed to create a
							language that was intended to be read easily by
							humans. The goal of making code that aimed to "write
							itself" contrasted from the more technical and
							computer readable coding languages of the time that
							were difficult to approach and even more challenging
							to master.
						</p>
						<q>
							I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the
							world to be productive, and to enjoy programming,
							and to be happy.
						</q>
						<span>- Matsumoto, 2008</span>
						<p>
							Though initially only popular and widely used in
							Japan, by the late 1990's and early 2000's,
							translations of the Ruby documentation into English
							along with the publishing of the book _Programming
							Ruby_, also written in English, led to a dramatic
							increase in overseas adoption.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ruby follows the principle of least astonishment, or
							that the language should behave in a way that
							minimizes confusion for experienced users. It should
							be enjoyable and straightforward.
